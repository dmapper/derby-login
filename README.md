# Derby-Login
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/dmapper/derby-login?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

- Auth module for Derby.js
- Derby 0.6 version is the only supported
- Written in pure js
- Uses [Passportjs](http://passportjs.org/)
- Email/Password and OAuth 2.0 providers
- Uses projections (data stored in one collection)
- All routes starts with '/auth/*'
- Bootstrap 3 components (Login, Register, ChangePassword)
- No jQuery dependency
- Influenced by [derby-auth](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth)

## Known Issues
- Does not work with Derby 0.3 and 0.5
- No support for OAuth 1.0 providers (ex. [passport-twitter](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-twitter))
- No 'Reset password'
- No built-in access control (maybe it`s better to create another module for this)
- If you have more than one page, you should subscribe '_session.user' [by yourself](https://github.com/derbyparty/derby-login/issues/3)
- No tests

### Installation
```
npm install derby-login
```

### Setting
#### Step 1. Require
```
var derbyLogin = require('derby-login');
```
#### Step 2. Options
```
var options = {
  collection: 'auths', // db collection
  publicCollection: 'users', // projection of db collection
  passport: {}, // passportjs options
  strategies: { // passportjs strategies
    provider1: {
      strategy: require('passport-provider1').Strategy,
      conf: {
        clientID: 'clientID',
        clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
      }
    },
    provider2: {
      strategy: require('passport-provider2').Strategy,
      conf: {
        clientID: 'clientID',
        clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
      }
    }
  },
  redirect: true, // Redirect all no authenticated requests to passport.failureRedirect
  user: { // projection
    id: true
  }
}
```

#### Step 3. Middleware
```
  .use(express.bodyParser()) //should be upper
  .use(derbyLogin.middleware(store, options))
```

### Example
- [derby-starter](https://github.com/vmakhaev/derby-starter/tree/auth) with auth
- [auth-example](https://github.com/vmakhaev/auth-example) simple app with auth
